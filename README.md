# Android App Pentesting Checklist

Welcome to the "Android App Penetration Testing Checklist" repository! This repository contains a checklist of tasks and techniques that can be used to perform a comprehensive security assessment of an Android application.

The checklist covers a range of topics, including:

**Static analysis:** reviewing the app's source code and resources for potential vulnerabilities

**Dynamic analysis:** analyzing the app's behavior and interactions with the device and network during runtime

**Network analysis:** analyzing the app's communication with servers and other external resources over the network

**Permission analysis:** reviewing the app's requested permissions and assessing whether they are appropriate and secure

**Cryptographic analysis:** reviewing the app's use of cryptography and ensuring that it is implemented securely

**Data storage analysis:** analyzing the app's handling of sensitive data, including how it is stored and transmitted

This checklist is intended as a starting point for penetration testers and bug bounty hunters to identify common security issues in Android applications. It is not a comprehensive guide to all possible security issues and should be used in conjunction with other resources and best practices.

|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|
|  | Content providers in Android are used to share data between applications. They use standard insert, update, delete, and query methods to access data and are assigned a special URI starting with "content://". If proper security controls are not implemented, it can lead to the leakage of information. An example of a content provider is the built-in SMS application, which can be accessed by other apps using a specific URI and the READ_SMS permission. There may be cases where content providers are not implemented for sharing data or where access is restricted to apps with proper permissions. |  |  |

|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|
|  | Insecure coding practice refers to the use of coding techniques or practices that do not adequately protect an application or system from security vulnerabilities or threats, such as using weak passwords or failing to properly validate user input.
